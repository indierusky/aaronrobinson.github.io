                                                My name is Aaron Robinson. I became intrigued by
                                                software engineering very early in life. It's probably rare for someone to discover their true love and passion so young in life. However, for me that was very much the case.
                                                At a very young age I formed a strong interest in math and science and always performed well in both subjects. I was
                                                fortunate enough to attend a high school that provided
                                                a computer science curriculum and concentrated my studies in computer science while in high school. The
                                                very
                                                first programming language I learned was Pascal and then
                                                I moved onto C and then C++ and C# in college. I took Advanced Placement computer science in high school and received college credit for
                                                computer
                                                science before attending college. I was selected to participate in an Engineering internship offered by the board
                                                of education
                                                and was placed with Thornton Tomasetti Engineers.  The internship further piqued my interest in engineering and I learned a great deal. 
                                                I was determined to be an engineer. I excelled tremendously
                                                in high school which enabled me to attend the University of Virginia(UVA) on full academic scholarship. My initial plan was
                                                to
                                                major in electrical enigeering. However, after taking my first programming class in college,
                                                my passion for coding was reignited. I chose to pursue computer science as my major with a minor in electrical
                                                engineering.
                                                UVA offers a very rigorous and competitive computer science program through the engineering
                                                school. I attended UVA during
                                                the huge tech boom of the 90's. Only 60 students out of a class of 520 for the year were allowed into the program.
                                                I performed very well my first two years at UVA and that allowed me to be selected into the computer science
                                                program. I had a
                                                great deal of interests in college and enrolled in a wide range of
                                                classes that were not required by my computer science curriculum. I stayed at the University of Virginia for six
                                                years
                                                before mostly completing the C.S. curriculum. I took a number of classes
                                                on Economics such as macroeconomics, microeconomics and personal investments. I also took a number of courses on
                                                Technology Management and Policy, that help prepare a young engineer for all aspects
                                                of the project and product life cycle, team management, project management,
                                                and
                                                preparing documentation. I truly enjoyed my college experience and even
                                                studied subjects that interested me like spanish, history, drama and astronomy.  I did not actually obtain a computer science degree from U.V.A    
                                                Computer science was my focus, however I studied many areas and I am a very well rounded individual
                                                with a true thirst
                                                for knowledge. In college I mastered programming in C++, C#, Java, Visual basic, Perl CGI script, Machine language,
                                                Assembly code and
                                                SQL. I also learned a great deal about cryptology, GUI design, data structures and algorithms,
                                                discrete math, linear algebra, differential equations
                                                and many more math and programming courses. After college I worked in many fields with many different titles. I even
                                                spent some time playing poker professionally. I found that my math, analytical skills
                                                and strong attention to detail gave me a significant advantage. Considering I had been away from programming for a
                                                number of years I decided to enroll in App Academy's boot camp to get reacquainted
                                                with the industry. Recently at App Academy I managed to gain great skills with modern day technologies such as
                                                Javascript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, Mongoose, SQL, Express and more. I utilized
                                                my skills in these new technologies to create a number a great projects listed below. I have loved programming since
                                                a
                                                young kid and I am eager to learn more and become the best software engineer I can be.
                                                I am a very fast learner and a true hard worker. </p>
